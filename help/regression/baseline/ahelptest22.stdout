PARAM coord

   type=string

   The coordinate system for x and y.

   The coordinate system for x and y. Currently only the sky 
   pixel or the detector physical coordinate system are allowed. 
   If SKY is selected the x and y are the sky physical 
   coordinates of the location on the detector where the user 
   wants the PSF model. If DET is selected, x and y are the 
   detector physical coordinates of the location on the detector 
   where the user wants the PSF model. (SKY|DET)
