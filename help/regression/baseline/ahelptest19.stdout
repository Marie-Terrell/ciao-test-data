DESCRIPTION

   For an energy, defocus and for requested x and y (sky or detector 
   physical) coordinates, this open-iraf C program extracts a PSF 
   model image from a given standard PSF library hypercube.

   The PSF library hypercube contains PSF-model images with pixel 
   sizes smaller or equal to the instrument pixels sizes, for a set 
   of energies and defocus positions.

   If the requested energy and/or coordinates do not match exactly 
   the energies and coordinates in the PSF library hypercube, the 
   program matches the given energy and position by linearly 
   interpolating between the PSF model images in the hypercube.

   Currently only the sky pixel (SKY) or the detector physical (DET) 
   coordinate system is allowed.

   If SKY is selected, the program will ask for an input file. If 
   DET is selected, the input file will not be used.

   If SKY is selected and an input image file is given, mkpsf will 
   automatically match the binning in the image and the output will 
   be a scaled PSF model image based on binning information provided 
   in the input file. The output PSF model image will be rotated by 
   the roll as specified by the keyword ROLL_NOM in the header of 
   the input file or in the parameter file (roll). The rotation is 
   approximate and is based on rotating a number of points per pixel 
   specified by rotpts.

   If DET is selected, the user will have to provide the values for 
   x and y in detector physical coordinates. The program will then 
   extract a PSF model from the hypercube corresponding to the 
   requested energy and position on the detector, and it will rotate 
   the image for a given roll.

   The output of the program is an image.
